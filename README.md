# Project Description

This project involves creating a responsive website layout using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The focus was on ensuring the design adapts to different screen sizes and devices through the use of **media queries**, as well as maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase using the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
- **Media Queries**: I used media queries to adjust the styles depending on the device's width, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.
  - **Desktop (1024px and up)**: Larger fonts and spacing for a comfortable reading experience.
  - **Tablet (640px to 1023px)**: Adjustments to ensure proper layout, fonts, and padding for medium-sized devices.
  - **Mobile (up to 639px)**: Optimized text sizes and layout to fit smaller screens while maintaining readability.
  
- **BEM Methodology**: I structured the CSS using the **BEM** (Block Element Modifier) methodology to ensure that the classes are descriptive and reusable. This helps in keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

## Key Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content layout.
- **CSS**: Styling the layout, implementing BEM, and using media queries.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements like the carousel and sliders.

## Structure

- **HTML**: Semantic HTML was used for accessibility and proper SEO.
- **CSS**: Modular CSS with the BEM naming convention for maintainability.
- **Media Queries**: Ensured that the website adjusts smoothly across devices.
